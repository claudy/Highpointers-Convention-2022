# Questions and Answers
Q: Do I have to sign this liability waiver? 
<br/>A: Yes. And do mail it in with your registration form. We'll make you sign it at the check-in table if you don't. 

Q: I'm under 18. Why does my parent or guardian have to sign? 
<br/>A: They must consent and sign on your behalf because you are not of legal age to sign on your own.
