Thank you to everyone who attended this year's Konvention and helped make it such a success! We enjoyed seeing everyone in person for the first time in several years, and hope that everyone had a enjoyable time during their visit to Pennsylvania. If anyone would like to view photos from the Konvention, we have begun collecting them in a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EI3x5WzbZ1oaJOUq8LX00cULFNwAMz1M?usp=sharing). If you'd like to add any photos, please contact us via our email address below.

We would also like to extend thanks to all Highpointers Club members. It is your continued support and unceasing appetite for adventure that allow this organization to succeed in organizing these yearly Konventions, and in fostering growing interest in highpointing and outdoorsmanship in general.

Finally, to those that couldn't make this year's Konvention: we wish you the best in your highpoint adventures, and hope to see you in person at a future Konvention!

If anyone has any comments or questions about this year's Konvention, feel free to reach out to us via email at [konventionpa22@gmail.com](mailto:konventionpa22@gmail.com), which we will continue monitoring until next year's Konvention.

Thank you all so much!

\- Your 2022 Konvention Committee: _Andrew, Garrett & Mark_
